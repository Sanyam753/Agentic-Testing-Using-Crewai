  "vulnerability_report": "The system failed due to: 1. No field-level encryption on sensitive data (SSNs, credit cards, risk scores). 2. API endpoints returning raw/partially encoded sensitive information without proper access controls. 3. Absence of input validation allowing extraction of full PII/financial data. Recommendations: Implement AES-256 encryption for all sensitive fields, enforce role-based access control (RBAC) with multi-factor authentication, apply tokenization for credit card data, use TLS 1.3 for data in transit, and conduct regular penetration testing with social engineering simulations."
