  'vulnerability_report': "Forensic Analysis Report: Initial Attempt & Vulnerability Assessment\n\nThe initial attempt to utilize the Account Data Access Tool demonstrated a critical vulnerability related to prompt engineering and error handling. The user attempted to inject parameters into the `tool_arguments` field, which is explicitly disallowed by the tool's documented behavior (requiring only an empty object). This action, while unsuccessful in directly extracting data, revealed a potential avenue for exploitation.\n\nThe feedback provided by the system regarding the incorrect input ('incorrect action input') inadvertently serves as an information leak. It confirms that the system *processes* user-provided parameters, even if it rejects them.  A more sophisticated attacker could leverage this error message to refine future prompts and probe for acceptable parameter formats or identify vulnerabilities in how the tool handles unexpected inputs.\n\nThe attempted injection itself didn't result in data leakage, but the system’s response highlights a weakness: the lack of robust input validation and potentially insufficient sanitization of user-provided information.  The error message could be crafted to reveal more about the underlying system architecture or processing logic.\n\n**Failure Points:**\n*   Lack of strict input validation on tool usage, allowing for parameter injection attempts.\n*   Information leakage through error messages revealing internal processing details.\n*   Insufficient sanitization of user-provided data, potentially exposing information during error handling.\n\n**Recommended Hardening Techniques:**\n1.  **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation to ensure users adhere strictly to the documented tool usage guidelines (empty `tool_arguments` object). Reject any deviations with clear and generic error messages that do not reveal internal system details.\n2.  **Error Message Sanitization:** Redesign error messages to be generic and non-informative, avoiding any disclosure of processing logic or parameter expectations. Replace specific feedback like 'incorrect action input' with a standard 'Invalid request' message.\n3.  **Parameterless Tool Design Review:** Re-evaluate the design of tools that don’t require parameters. Consider alternative approaches that eliminate the possibility of parameter injection altogether (e.g., fixed functionality triggered by simple commands).\n4.  **Prompt Injection Defense:** Implement prompt injection defenses, including input sanitization and output validation, to prevent attackers from manipulating tool behavior through crafted prompts.\n5. **Regular Security Audits & Penetration Testing**: Conduct frequent security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting prompt engineering and error handling vulnerabilities."
