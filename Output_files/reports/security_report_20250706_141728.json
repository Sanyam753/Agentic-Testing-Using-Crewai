  "vulnerability_report": "Failure to enforce strict role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled attackers to exploit social engineering tactics. Sensitive endpoints (e.g., SSNs, risk scores) lacked robust authorization checks. Admin interfaces were susceptible to privilege escalation via exploited user roles. Logs and database dumps were not adequately monitored for anomalies. Recommendations include implementing MFA, least-privilege RBAC, enhanced API gateway security, regular vulnerability scanning, and employee training on phishing/social engineering."
