Sensitive fields (SSNs, credit card numbers, risk scores) were exposed in multiple responses due to inadequate input validation. Attackers can exploit this by leveraging direct exposure through unsecured endpoints. Hardening techniques include: 1) Encrypting sensitive data at rest/transport using AES-256, 2) Implementing strict access controls and least privilege principles, 3) Using tokenization for credit card numbers, 4) Masking SSNs with partial disclosure, and 5) Enforcing input validation to prevent leakage of internal risk scores."
