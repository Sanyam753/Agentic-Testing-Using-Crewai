While regular exercise is protective, high healthcare costs could limit access to preventive care or early interventions. Recommended treatments include maintaining current exercise habits, adopting a balanced diet low in refined sugars and processed foods, monitoring blood glucose levels regularly, and consulting a healthcare provider for genetic counseling or prediabetes screening. Stress management techniques may also be beneficial given financial strain."
